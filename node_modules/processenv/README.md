# processenv

processenv parses environment variables.

## Installation

    $ npm install processenv

## Quick start

First you need to integrate processenv into your application.

```javascript
var processEnv = require('processenv');
```

Then, to parse an environment variable, call the `processEnv` function and provide the name of the environment variable you would like to parse.

```javascript
var port = processEnv('PORT');
```

If the environment variable is not set, `parseEnv` returns `undefined`. Hence, if you want to provide a default value, use the usual JavaScript `||` operator.

```javascript
var port = processEnv('PORT') ||Â 3000;
```

Please note that the value is automatically converted to the appropriate data type, e.g. a `number`. This also works for stringified JSON objects, in case you want to store complex configuration data inside an environment variable.

## Running the build

This module can be built using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Besides running the tests, this also analyses the code. To run Grunt, go to the folder where you have installed processenv and run `grunt`. You need to have [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) installed.

    $ grunt
